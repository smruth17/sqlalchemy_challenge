Homework 10
In Homework 10, there were two parts. The first part was to analyze and explore the climate data provided by two csv files. I also was given  a climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite file. In the first part of the homework in my Jupyter Notebook, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Datetime librairies to find specific precipitation, temperature, date, and station data. Then I saved it to a Pandas DataFrame and plotted two of the queries. In the second part, I used the hawaii.sqlite file and the Flask application to bind the session between the python app and database in VS code. I created API static routes and two dynamic routes and used the queries that were created in the first part of the assignment. I received help from Alexander, the TA's, fellow classmates, and the Xpert learning assistant.
